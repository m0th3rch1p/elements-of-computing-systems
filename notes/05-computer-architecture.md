## The Stored Program Concept
Considered to be one of the most profound inventions in all of computer science, the stored program concept (also known as 'software'), allows for a fixed hardware platform that is capable of executing a fixed set of instructions to execute arbitrary programs stored in memory allowing for dynamic applications as opposed to a fixed set of programs stored within the machines hardware that cannot be altered.
